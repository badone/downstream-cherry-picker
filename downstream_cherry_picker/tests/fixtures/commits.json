      "message": "rgw: cmake: remove useless civetweb include path side effect.\n\nFor 'target_include_directories\" for the cmake object library\n'civetweb_common_objs', change from PUBLIC to PRIVATE.  This doesn't\nbreak anything, so it wasn't doing anything useful.  If it has it\nany effect, it would be to cause everything that linked against this\n\"library\" to also use the indictated include path.  Which would be great\nexcept everything in ceph wants to include \"civetweb/civetweb.h\" and\nnot \"civetweb.h\".  We already make separate arrangements elsewhere for\nthat to work.  Additionally, static object libraries in cmake aren't\nreally libraries, so I'm not entirely sure this even does anything.\nSo: making this public is not useful, and could be harmful.  Making it\nprivate makes this only take effect for building civetweb.c itself,\nexactly the effect we we require, and no more.\n\nSigned-off-by: Marcus Watts <mwatts@redhat.com>\n(cherry picked from commit 8308a13b0257c9460fd2a721c20b0c37cb9e7c57)",

      "message": "rgw: Handle multiple listening addreses w/ optional ssl \"correctly\" with civetweb.\n\nFor civetweb: accept a range of port numbers joined with '+'.\nPort numbers may include an ipaddress: prefix and 's' suffix.\nAdditionally, use \"mg_get_local_addr\" to correctly deduce host port per\nincoming connection.\n\ncivetweb can accept connections on multiple ports, some of which\nmight have SSL turned on and some not.  Both s3 and swift have various\nauthorization protocols in which the port number matters.  In the generic\nradosgw frontend process, each frontend only has one port number, but\nwe should want to have both ssl and non-ssl connections managed within\none rgw frontend, because the thread pool is also per front-end, and\nthat *is* a scarce resource.\n\nSo, this patch enables the use of multiple ports with a single civetweb\nfrontend.  To indicate https: append an 's' to portno.  To use multiple\nports, use +.  So 80+443s indicates use of the usual default http ports.\nThe parsed port is not stored in the frontend structure,\n\nSo instead, this patch adds logic to use the results of\nmg_get_local_addr() on a per-connection basis insetad of the generic\nfront-end port number.  This will affect \"v4\" s3 authorization, and also\naffect swift pre-signed URLs.\n\nmg_get_local_addr() is a new customization to civetweb; that submodule\nwas updated (in a temporary repository) by the previous commit to this.\n\nSigned-off-by: Marcus Watts <mwatts@redhat.com>\n(cherry picked from commit 8bc6decc0774fae9ac881f91e73da55deebe3360)",
